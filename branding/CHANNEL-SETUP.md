### Description (long) — 924 chars (YouTube limit 1000)
```
TalonBots Labs deploys production-grade bots and agents across every major cloud — reproducibly, cost-consciously, and without surprises.

Every episode: pick a bot, an agent, or an automation; deploy it on real infrastructure with reproducible code; film it; then destroy it before anyone sees a surprise bill. No click-ops. No "works on my machine." No cloud bills left running.

The bot is always the star. The cloud just changes — Azure one week, GCP the next, Proxmox or Oracle Free Tier after.

What you'll find here:
- IaC deployments (Terraform, Bicep, cloud-native), code in the GitHub org
- AI agent + LLM infra (LiteLLM, MCP servers, multi-agent patterns)
- Cost-controlled cloud across Azure, GCP, AWS, Oracle, and Proxmox
- Honest walkthroughs, including the parts that break

Every video has a matching repo at github.com/TalonBots. Fork it, deploy it, then destroy it.

Automate everything. Nuke the evidence.

## Account / ownership notes
- Channel is a **Brand Account** (separate identity, supports multiple managers, transferable).
- Anchored under your Google account (sign in as the same account you created it with — likely `sun.lemunyon@gmail.com`).
- `hello@talonbots.com` is a forwarding alias, not a Google login — it's only the public *contact* email, set in Basic info.
- Monetization (YPP/AdSense) later ties to the owning Google account.
